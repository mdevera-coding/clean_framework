/// CHALLENGUES:
/// 1) Errors that should show a dialog have not been covered by guidelines.
///   The main problem is that dialogs should be shown only once, but the
///   ViewModels have flags that tells the presenter to show errors. To ensure
///   that only they are shown once, probably the Presenter should be a
///   Stateful Widget, and absorb the error logic, similar to how we handle
///   navigation with RouterWidget
/// 2) Validation of data is also not covered in guidelines. Our forms
///   are handler by business logic in the feature. Sometimes it is fully
///   done by the bloc, but there are currently issues when dealing with Text
///   Controllers.

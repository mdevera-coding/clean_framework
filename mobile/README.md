## Setting up your Mockoon environment

Following are the instructions for setting up your Mockoon routes for each screen.
*Make sure your port is set to 3001.*
Having these routes set correctly and having the Mockoon environment running during your tests is **essential** to these tests passing.
Please keep this updated regarding the information you are testing against.
For information on installing and setting up Mockoon, please see mockoon.md.
A JSON export from Mockoon of the environment can be found in the mockoon folder.
